# Precedents 内容方案

## 更新后的 Precedents 列表（7个）

### 1. MIT Tangible Media Group - inFORM
**链接：** https://tangible.media.mit.edu/project/inform/
**状态：** 保留

**描述：**
MIT's inFORM is a shape-changing table that reacts to human gestures, making data physical. The system uses actuator grids and computational mapping to translate digital input into haptic output. Its audience includes designers, accessibility researchers, and people needing embodied interaction.

This precedent demonstrates how physical interfaces can translate abstract data into tangible experiences. However, my project differs by focusing on wearable, portable devices rather than table-scale installations, and by integrating sound-to-touch translation specifically for blind users.

### 2. Replika (AI Companion)
**链接：** https://replika.com/
**状态：** 保留

**描述：**
Replika is a chatbot app with adaptive, emotionally supportive voice/text interactions. Its audience includes general users seeking companionship and the mental health community. The methodology uses machine learning trained on dialogue, with feedback loops for tone adaptation.

This precedent shows how AI can provide emotional support through voice interaction. My project differs by focusing specifically on blind users' needs, prioritizing transparency and ethical voice design rather than commercial therapy-like chat.

### 3. Wearable Multichannel Pulse Condition Monitoring System (TCM)
**链接：** https://www.nature.com/articles/s41378-022-00349-3
**状态：** 保留并更新描述

**描述：**
This research from Nature Microsystems & Nanoengineering created a wearable multichannel pulse monitoring system based on flexible pressure sensor arrays. The system simultaneously detects pulse conditions at three TCM pulse positions (Chi, Cun, and Guan) using 3×3 pressure sensor arrays at each location. It uses signal acquisition, processing, and 3-dimensional fitting to create pulse maps that reveal the shape of pulse length and width, similar to what doctors feel with their fingertips.

My project takes this idea further but in reverse: instead of measuring the body's internal state, I design a way for the body to feel the external world—turning sound and emotion into vibration along the same meridian points. While their system tracks energy flow for diagnosis, mine uses energy flow for perception and interaction, creating a new sensory language between sound, body, and space.

**关键点：**
- Flexible pressure sensor arrays
- 3D pulse mapping
- Multichannel detection at TCM points
- Spatial and temporal pulse information

### 4. SubPac X1 (Haptic Audio System)
**链接：** https://subpac.com/x1/
**状态：** 保留并更新链接

**描述：**
SubPac X1 is a wearable haptic audio system that translates sound into body sensations through vibration. It's used by musicians, audio professionals, and Deaf/hard-of-hearing users to experience music and audio through tactile feedback rather than just hearing. The system provides deep, accurate bass and full-spectrum haptic feedback.

This precedent demonstrates the value of vibroacoustic communication and shows that mainstream acceptance of non-visual audio interfaces is growing. My project builds on this by focusing specifically on spatial perception and environmental awareness for blind users, rather than just music appreciation. The technology validates the approach of using vibration to convey information that would otherwise be visual or auditory.

**关键点：**
- Full-spectrum haptic audio
- Wearable design
- Used by Deaf/hard-of-hearing community
- Translates audio to tactile sensation

### 5. Ear Seeds (TCM Auriculotherapy)
**链接：** https://www.earseeds.com/
**状态：** 保留

**描述：**
Ear Seeds are a gentle, non-invasive practice from Traditional Chinese Medicine ear therapy (auriculotherapy). Small metal or crystal beads are taped onto specific points on the ear, providing light pressure and stimulating related meridian points. The ear is seen as a "mini map" of the whole body, with each point linking to certain body parts and emotions. Often used for stress, sleep, mood, and pain relief.

This precedent is relevant because it shows how TCM concepts of energy points and meridian pathways can be applied to wearable, non-invasive devices. My project adapts this concept to the wrist meridian points, using modern technology (vibration motors) instead of physical beads, but maintaining the principle of stimulating specific energy points to affect perception and well-being.

**关键点：**
- Non-invasive TCM therapy
- Meridian point stimulation
- Wearable application
- Energy flow concept

### 6. Feel Therapeutics (Haptic Therapy)
**链接：** https://www.feeltherapeutics.com/
**状态：** 新增

**描述：**
Feel Therapeutics develops haptic therapy solutions that use vibration and tactile feedback for therapeutic applications. The platform focuses on using haptic technology to provide sensory experiences that can support mental health, stress relief, and emotional well-being through controlled vibration patterns.

This precedent is relevant because it demonstrates how haptic technology can be used for therapeutic and emotional support purposes, not just functional feedback. My project builds on this concept by combining haptic therapy with spatial perception and sound-to-touch translation, creating a system that provides both functional navigation support and emotional care for blind users. The therapeutic aspect aligns with my CARE mode, which focuses on daily reflection and emotional support.

**关键点：**
- Haptic therapy applications
- Emotional and mental health support
- Vibration patterns for wellness
- Therapeutic use of tactile feedback

### 7. Gua Sha (Traditional Chinese Medicine Therapy)
**链接：** https://www.healthline.com/health/gua-sha
**状态：** 新增

**描述：**
Gua Sha (刮痧) is a traditional Chinese medicine therapy technique that involves scraping the skin with a smooth tool to stimulate blood flow and energy (qi) along meridian pathways. The practice creates temporary marks on the skin and is believed to release tension, improve circulation, and balance energy flow. It's used for pain relief, inflammation reduction, and overall wellness.

This precedent is relevant because it demonstrates how physical stimulation along meridian pathways can affect the body's energy flow and perception. My project adapts this concept by using vibration instead of scraping, but follows the same principle of stimulating meridian points to influence energy flow and bodily sensation. The connection between physical touch, energy pathways, and perception aligns with my project's approach of using meridian points as channels for sensory information.

**关键点：**
- TCM meridian stimulation technique
- Energy flow (qi) concept
- Physical touch affecting perception
- Connection between body and energy pathways
